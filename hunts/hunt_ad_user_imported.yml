title: Hunt on Users Imported from Active Directory
id: 66d64a35d10d45f9b6b9c7dadaff6d82
description: |-
  Detects when an Okta AD Agent is used to import a user into the Okta environment.
  This may indicate an adversary has established a new Active Directory (AD) agent and imported users to facilitate further access or persistence within an environment.
  Therefore , this hunting rule can be utilised to query for imported users, in correlation with the "New AD Agent Created" detection rule.
  This hunting rule is particularly relevant for environments where AD integration is NOT generally used for delegated user management and authentication.
  Known authorized AD Agents may be excluded from the rule, in order to limit noise from benign activity.

    - Persistence
  Technique:
    - T1136.003: "Create Account: Cloud Account"
prevention:
  - Apply the principle of least privilege. Create Custom Admin Roles that exclude this permission (okta.agents.manage) for all but a minimal number of essential administrators.
  - For the few administrators who require agent management permissions, eliminate standing privileges. Use Okta Access Requests to grant these permissions on a just-in-time (JIT) basis, requiring a time-bound session and an explicit approval workflow (dual authorization) from another administrator.
  - Mandate the use of high-assurance authenticators like FIDO2 WebAuthn or Okta FastPass for all administrative roles.
  - Enforce dedicated admin policies - Assign all administrators to groups. Require users in these groups to sign-in from managed devices and via phishing resistant MFA (Okta FastPass, FIDO2 WebAuthn). Restrict this access to trusted Network Zones and deny access from anonymizing proxies.

      eventType eq "system.agent.ad.imported_user"
false_positives:
  - Legitimate importing of users from Active Directory (AD) by an authorized AD Agent for legitimate purposes, such as onboarding new employees or synchronizing user accounts.
