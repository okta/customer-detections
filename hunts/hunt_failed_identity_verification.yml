threat:
  Tactic:
    - Defense Evasion
  Technique:
    - T1656: Impersonation
    - T1556.006: Modify Authentication Process.Multi-Factor Authentication
prevention:
  - At the 3rd party IDV level, configure selfie liveness verification against the user's photo ID.
  - Leverage MDL (based on cryptographic signatures to prevent forgery) once it becomes more widely available instead of users scanning their ID.
detection:
  okta_systemlog:
    OIE: |
      eventType eq "user.identity_verification" and outcome.result eq "DENY"
false_positives:
  - Selfie image verification may timeout and the user may need to retry for IDV to complete successfully.
