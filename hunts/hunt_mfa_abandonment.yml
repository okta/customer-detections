title: Hunt on MFA Abandonment
id: 1d8e2e061cbf17326933d17f61881b5c
description: |
  Detects MFA events that were abandoned. If an MFA prompt is not accepted or completed after a set period of time, it will be abandoned.
  An adversary with access to compromised passwords may try to push bomb the victim hoping they accept the MFA prompt.
  Note: This is currently early access (as of April 10th, 2025) and must be enabled under "Settings > Features" in the admin console.

threat:
  Tactic:
    - Credential Access
  Technique:
    - T1621: Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation
prevention:
  - Protect sign-in flows by enforcing strong MFA authenticators such as phishing-resistance with Okta FastPass and FIDO2 WebAuthn.
  - Implement passwordless authentication within your Okta tenant (https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/password-optional/password-optional-disabled.htm)
  - Require devices authenticating through your Okta tenant to be managed via authentication policies.

      eventType eq "user.authentication.auth_via_mfa" and (outcome.result eq "UNANSWERED" or outcome.result eq "ABANDONED")
false_positives:
  - Users not responding to legitimate MFA prompts
  - Further filter this to look for multiple instances against a single account or events from known proxies.
