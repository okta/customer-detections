  Detects when a a new device is added to a user that doesn't follow standard hostname nomenclature used at a specific company
  An adversary with access to a compromised account may enroll their own device to leverage as MFA. This device does not often follow standard hostname nomenclature used in the company.

  Tactic:
    - Credential Access
    - Defense Evasion
    - Persistence
  Technique:
    - T1556.006: Modify Authentication Process - Multi-Factor Authentication
    - T1078: Valid Accounts
prevention:
  - Configure authentication policies to only allow managed devices to authenticate.
  - If unmanaged devices are required, configure device assurance policies to ensure all devices meet a secure baseline. 
  - Configure strong policy-based enrolments. Using a combination of Event Hooks, Okta Workflows and Okta Account Management policy, create a policy where after initial enrollment, all subsequent enrollments require phishing resistant MFA.

  explanation: | 
    The query below:
    Retrieves authentication or global session policy update events.
    Parses useful fields from JSON to display and filter on.
    Filters on successful policy updates where the policy changed from requiring 2FA to only requiring 1FA.
    Aggregates the output by the user performing the update and log ID.

false_positives:
    - Approved changes to authentication policies where downgrading MFA is expected
