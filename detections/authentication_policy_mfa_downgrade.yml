title: Authentication Policy MFA Downgrade
id: 0c2634a68f9ac593c58349e0de80bb67
description: |
  Detects when an Okta Administrator changes an authentication policy from requiring 2FA to only requiring 1FA.
  An adversary with access to a compromised Okta Admin account may try to downgrade MFA for certain applications such as password managers to bypass MFA.

  Tactic:
    - Credential Access
    - Defense Evasion
    - Persistence
  Technique:
    - T1556.006: Modify Authentication Process - Multi-Factor Authentication
prevention:
  - Implement Zero Standing Privileges via Okta Govern Admin Roles (https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/governance-admin-roles/govern-admin-roles.htm).
  - Enable Protected Actions to force re-authentication whenever an administrative user attempts to perform sensitive actions.
  - Enforce dedicated admin policies - Assign all administrators to groups. Require users in these groups to sign-in from managed devices and via phishing resistant MFA (Okta FastPass, FIDO2 WebAuthn). Restrict this access to trusted Network Zones and deny access from anonymizing proxies.

  explanation: | 
    The query below:
    Retrieves successful policy update events (policy.rule.update)
    Extract relevant JSON from the log to display in the search
    Filters on policy updates where the policy changed from requiring 2FA to only requiring 1FA using the target fields
    Display results grouped by the policy name and rule ID that was changed. 
  splunk: |
    index=* sourcetype=OktaIM2:log eventType="policy.rule.update" outcome.result=SUCCESS 
    | spath target{} output=targets 
    | eval PolicyRuleChanges=mvindex(targets,1) 
    | spath input=PolicyRuleChanges path=displayName output=policy_changed 
    | spath input=PolicyRuleChanges path=id output=policy_rule_id 
    ```Parse out the changeDetails that show specifically what was changed within the authentication policy```
    | spath input=PolicyRuleChanges path=changeDetails.from.policyRuleActionJson output=change_from 
    | spath input=PolicyRuleChanges path=changeDetails.to.policyRuleActionJson output=change_to 
    ```Extract the factorMode field from Nested JSON which displays whether the authentication policy requires 1FA or 2FA```
    | spath input=change_from path="appSignOn.verificationMethod.factorMode" output=from_factor 
    | spath input=change_to path="appSignOn.verificationMethod.factorMode" output=to_factor 
    ```Filter on the factorMode field to look for when the authentication policy was originally set to 2FA then was changed to 1FA```
    | where from_factor = "2FA" AND to_factor = "1FA" 
    ```Display the information in a table```
    | stats values(actor.id) as user_id values(actor.alternateId) as username values(client.ipAddress) as src_ip values(client.userAgent.rawUserAgent) as user_agent values(from_factor) as original_factor values(to_factor) as changed_to_factor
  false_positives:
    - Approved changes to authentication policies where downgrading MFA is expected
