  Tactic:
    - Persistence
  Technique:
    - T1078: Valid Accounts
prevention:
  - Implement Zero Standing Privileges via Okta Govern Admin Roles (https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/governance-admin-roles/govern-admin-roles.htm)
  - Assign administrators Custom Admin Roles with the least permissions required for daily tasks, and require dual authorization for JIT (just-in-time) access to more privileged roles.
  - Enable Protected Actions to force re-authentication whenever an administrative user attempts to perform sensitive actions.
  - Protect sign-in flows by enforcing phishing-resistant authentication with Okta FastPass and FIDO2 WebAuthn.
  - Enforce dedicated admin policies - Assign all administrators to groups. Require users in these groups to sign-in from managed devices and via phishing resistant MFA (Okta FastPass, FIDO2 WebAuthn). Restrict this access to trusted Network Zones and deny access from anonymizing proxies.
