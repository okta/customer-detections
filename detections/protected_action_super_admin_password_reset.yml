prevention:
  - Enable Protected Actions to force re-authentication whenever an administrative user attempts to perform sensitive actions like a Super Admin password reset.
  - Implement Zero Standing Privileges via Okta Govern Admin Roles for Super Administrators.
  - Mandate the use of high-assurance authenticators like FIDO2 WebAuthn or Okta FastPass for all Super Administrator roles.
  - Enforce dedicated admin policies - Restrict access to Super Admin roles from trusted Network Zones and deny access from anonymizing proxies.
