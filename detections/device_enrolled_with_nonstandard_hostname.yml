title: Device Enrolled with Non-Standard Hostname
id: 4f6161a02dbd790f1b1c2c9f5287ab45
description: |
  Detects when a new device is enrolled by a user that doesn't follow standard hostname nomenclature used in the organization.
  An adversary with access to a compromised account may enroll their own device to leverage as MFA. This device does not often follow standard hostname nomenclature used in the organization.

  Tactic:
    - Credential Access
    - Defense Evasion
    - Persistence
  Technique:
    - T1556.006: Modify Authentication Process - Multi-Factor Authentication
    - T1078: Valid Accounts
prevention:
  - Configure authentication policies to only allow managed devices to authenticate.
  - If unmanaged devices are required, configure device assurance policies to ensure all devices meet a secure baseline. 
  - Configure strong policy-based enrolments. Using a combination of Event Hooks, Okta Workflows and Okta Account Management policy, create a policy where after initial enrollment, all subsequent enrollments require phishing resistant MFA.

  explanation: | 
    The query below:
    Retrieves device enrollment and device added log events.
    Extracts relevant fields from the raw log.
    Filters where the hostname of the device being enrolled doesn't match a regex that follows your organization's nomenclature.

    index=main sourcetype=OktaIM2:log AND eventType IN ("device.user.add", "device.enrollment.create") ```OPTIONAL: To filter only on Computers and not Mobile Devices add: AND client.device="Computer"```

    | spath "target{}.detailEntry.osPlatform" output="OS"

    ```Filter when the name of the device being enrolled doesn't follow standard hostname nomenclature regex```

false_positives:
    - Mobile phone hostnames that aren't expected to follow any sort of hostname standard. Tune this rule to exclude mobile devices.
    - Legitimate BYOD or personal devices that a user enrolls.
