  Detects when a phone number is registered to multiple users.
  An adversary may register the same SMS phone number as MFA to multiple accounts they have compromised in order to maintain persistence.
  This detections requires the Okta org to allow SMS as an MFA factor.

  Tactic:
    - Credential Access
    - Defense Evasion
    - Persistence
  Technique:
    - T1556.006: Modify Authentication Process.Multi-Factor Authentication
prevention:
  - Require strong MFA factors and do not allow factors such as email or SMS.
  - Configure strong Okta account management policies to lock down or place strict restrictions on MFA enrollment
detection:
  explanation: |
    The query below:
    Retrieves events where an SMS phone MFA message is sent, this event includes the Mobile ID and phone number.
    Extracts the mobile phone ID from the target fields, this ID is the same when the phone number is the same.
    Groups the results by the "MobilePhone" that was used, and counts the distinct number of userIDs that leveraged that respective "MobilePhone"
    Alerts when 2 or more unique user IDs were observed using the same mobile phone number for SMS verification. It's recommended to run this query over a longer period of time.

  - Service accounts leveraging a shared device
