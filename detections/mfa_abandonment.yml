title: MFA Abandonment
id: a01d6b5a01ffdc32eba39244b1662201
description: |
  Detects when a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) prompt is unanswered or abandoned multiple times by a user.
  While this can sometimes be benign (e.g., user error), multiple MFA abandonment events could indicate a security threat.
  For example, multiple abandoned prompts could indicate a potential brute force attack or password spraying attack attempting to bypass the MFA challenge.
  This detection focuses on accounts where MFA challenge outcomes are "UNANSWERED" or "ABANDONED".

  Tactic:
    - Credential Access
  Technique:
    - T1110: Brute Force
prevention:
  - Enforce global and application-specific MFA policies that limit the number of failed attempts within a specified time window.
  - Require phishing-resistant authentication methods (like Okta FastPass or FIDO2 WebAuthn) for high-value user groups.
  - Monitor users' behavioral risk scores (if available) to detect anomalies associated with repeated MFA failure.

      eventType eq "user.authentication.auth_via_mfa" AND outcome.result in ["UNANSWERED", "ABANDONED"]
false_positives:
  - Legitimate user error where a prompt was unintentionally missed or ignored.
  - A user who attempts to sign in from a new device or location, and abandons the MFA flow after realizing they don't have the factor available.
  - A user accidentally closing the browser or application before completing the MFA challenge.
