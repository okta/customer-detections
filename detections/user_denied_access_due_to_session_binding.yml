title: User Denied Access due to Session Binding
id: 1fae6f177a9b8ab64d8d31781ae5926f
description: |
  Detects violations of Okta's built-in ASN binding feature for administrative sessions.
  This feature is enabled by default and fires an event when it detects an ASN change mid-session for administrators.
  An adversary may steal okta session cookies for an administrative session and import them onto their own device connected to a separate ASN.

threat:
  Tactic:
    - Credential Access
  Technique:
    - T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie
prevention:
    - Implement Zero Standing Privileges via Okta Govern Admin Roles (https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/governance-admin-roles/govern-admin-roles.htm)
    - Assign administrators Custom Admin Roles with the least permissions required for daily tasks, and require dual authorization for JIT (just-in-time) access to more privileged roles.
    - Enable Protected Actions (under Settings > Features) to force re-authentication whenever an administrative user attempts to perform sensitive actions.
    - Protect sign-in flows by enforcing phishing-resistant authentication with Okta FastPass and FIDO2 WebAuthn.
    - Enforce dedicated admin policies - Assign all administrators to groups. Require users in these groups to sign-in from managed devices and via phishing resistant MFA (Okta FastPass, FIDO2 WebAuthn). Restrict this access to trusted Network Zones and deny access from anonymizing proxies.
