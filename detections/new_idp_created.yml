title: Creation of a new Okta Identity Provider
id: 5081584907f1037ac2e423866b55c433
description: |
  Detects creation of an external identity provider.
  Threat actors may configure a second Identity Provider to act as an "impersonation app" to access applications within the compromised Org on behalf of other users.
  This second Identity Provider, also controlled by the attacker, would act as a “source” IdP in an inbound federation relationship (sometimes called “Org2Org”) with the target.

threat:
  Tactic:
    - Persistence
    - Lateral Movement
  Technique:
    - T1078: Valid Accounts
    - T1550: Use Alternate Authentication Material
prevention:
  - Implement Zero Standing Privileges via Okta Govern Admin Roles (https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/governance-admin-roles/govern-admin-roles.htm)
  - Assign administrators Custom Admin Roles with the least permissions required for daily tasks, and require dual authorization for JIT (just-in-time) access to more privileged roles.
  - Enable Protected Actions (under Settings > Features) to force re-authentication whenever an administrative user attempts to perform sensitive actions.
  - Protect sign-in flows by enforcing phishing-resistant authentication with Okta FastPass and FIDO2 WebAuthn.
  - Enforce dedicated admin policies - Assign all administrators to groups. Require users in these groups to sign-in from managed devices and via phishing resistant MFA (Okta FastPass, FIDO2 WebAuthn). Restrict this access to trusted Network Zones and deny access from anonymizing proxies.

      eventType eq "system.idp.lifecycle.create"
false_positives:
  - Legitimate new IDPs being created, should be very rare
  - To alert on all events relating to an IDP leverage this query - eventType sw "system.idp.lifecycle"
